HOW TO USE THESE FILES

	To run countWords.py, start the program. The top 20 words
	of President Bush will appear along with a graph visualizing them.
	In order to see the top 20 words of President Obama as well as his
	visualization, you will need to close the Bush graph first.
	
	To run visualizeText.py, simply start the program and wait for the
	graph to appear.
	
WHAT DOES AND DOESN'T WORK

	The only thing that we had trouble with in our project was the inability to visualize the two graphs simultaneously in countWords.py. As a result, one graph prints after the other is closed. Everything else went well.

OUR EXPERIENCE

	We had a pleasant experience with this project. Initially, it seemed overwhelming to have to decide on the functions we were going to use and organizing everything seemed as if it would be a challenge, but it actually ended up running smoothly. Contrary to our initial beliefs, it wasnâ€™t as difficult as we imagined to find common times to meet and work on the project. To collaborate between computers, we used GitHub to post our updated programs so we could discuss and share them with each other in real time. Overall, our experience went relatively smoothly, and allowed us to put our cumulative knowledge together to produce a program that we are proud of and works how we want it to.
